      "I'm a Software Engineer with a strong passion for software design (think clean architecture, not just UI/UX), open source and a deep concern for the environment. For the past 5 years, I honed my skills at Atos working with Java EE, Spring and Angular on enterprise projects. Notably, I had the privilege of contributing to 3 projects for the French Ministry of Ecology, which fueled my desire to leverage technology for positive environmental impact. In the last 3 years, I've transitioned to a more modern stack, diving deep into TypeScript, NestJS, and React. My ultimate goal? Taking complex systems and making them beautifully elegant.",

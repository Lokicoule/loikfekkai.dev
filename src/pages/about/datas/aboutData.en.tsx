        You know that feeling when you're working on a project and the codebase is so <strong>convoluted</strong> you can't even understand your own code from last week?
        <br />
        <br />
        I've been there. <strong>Too many times</strong>. That's why I became <strong>obsessed</strong> with <strong>software design</strong>, <strong>clean architecture</strong>, and <strong>making things simpler</strong>.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started at <strong>Atos</strong>, working on <strong>Java/Spring/Angular</strong> projects for the <strong>Ministry of Ecology</strong>. It reinforced something important for me: technology should <strong>serve a purpose</strong>, <strong>solve real problems</strong>, and ideally <strong>make the world a bit better</strong>.
        <br />
        <br />
        For the past few years, I've been deep in the <strong>TypeScript</strong> ecosystem (<strong>Node.js, React, NestJS</strong>). Not because they're trendy, but because they let me focus on what matters: building things that <strong>work well</strong> and are <strong>easy to maintain</strong>.
        <br />
        <br />
        My goal? <strong>Strip away the unnecessary</strong>. <strong>Simplify</strong> what can be simplified. Write code that future developers (including me) <strong>won't curse at</strong>.

        For me, <strong>clean code</strong> isn't about aesthetics: it's a way to build <strong>lasting systems</strong> that stay <strong>simple to maintain</strong>. My <strong>tendency toward abstraction</strong> might seem excessive, but it ensures <strong>testable code</strong> and <strong>well-defined responsibilities</strong>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Comfortable from backend to frontend</strong>. <strong>TypeScript</strong> is my <strong>language of choice</strong> — for the <strong>safety</strong> it provides and the <strong>DX</strong> it delivers.
        <br />
        <br />
        I like <strong>digging into business logic</strong>, understanding what lies behind <strong>ambiguous needs</strong>, and deriving <strong>clear solutions</strong>, <strong>coherent</strong>, and <strong>lasting</strong> from it.

        When I'm not behind my screen, you'll probably find me on the waves in Mimizan, a small coastal town near Bordeaux.
        <br />
        <br />
        Surfing and coding, that's my way of balancing things. One clears my mind, the other fills it. One teaches me to let go, the other to solve. And between the two, I find what inspires me: movement, focus, the search for the right flow.
        <br />
        <br />
        Working remotely, I've learned to maintain that balance: moving forward efficiently, without sacrificing what matters. The result? More clarity, more energy, and above all more joy in what I create.

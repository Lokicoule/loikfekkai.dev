      "I am a fullstack developer passionate about software design and concerned about the future of our planet. In the early years of my career, I honed my skills at Atos, primarily working with a Java, Spring, and Angular stack. I had the privilege of contributing to several projects for the Ministry of Ecology, an experience that reinforced my desire to use technology for a positive environmental impact. For the past three years, I have turned to more modern technologies, exploring TypeScript, NodeJS, and React in depth. My goal? To get back to basics by simplifying what can be simplified.",

      <>
        When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll find me on the waves in
        Mimizan, a small coastal town near Bordeaux. Surfing and coding are the
        perfect balance for me, providing essential life balance.
        <br />
        As a remote developer, I harmonize these two passions to foster personal
        growth while bringing renewed energy and total commitment to your
        projects, no matter where I am.
